## Usage

### createSigner

Create a signer function by calling `createSigner` and providing one or more of the following options:

- `secret`: A string, buffer or object containing the secret for `HS*` algorithms or the PEM encoded public key for `RS*`, `PS*` and `ES*` algorithms (whose format is defined by the Node's crypto module documentation). The secret can also be a function accepting a Node style callback or a function returning a promise. This is the only mandatory option.
- `algorithm`: The algorithm to use to sign the token, default is `HS256`.
- `encoding`: The token encoding, default is `utf-8`.
- `useWorkers`: Use worker_threads for cryptographic operations. On Node version below 11.7.0, this needs the process to be started with node flag `--experimental-workers` flag.
- `mutatePayload`: If the original payload must be modified in place (via `Object.assign`) and thus will result changed to the caller funciton.
- `expiresIn`: Time span (in milliseconds) after which the token expires, added as the `exp` claim in the payload. This will override any existing value in the claim.
- `notBefore`: Time span (in milliseconds) before the token is active, added as the `nbf` claim in the payload. This will override any existing value in the claim.
- `jti`: The token id, added as the `jti` claim in the payload. This will override any existing value in the claim.
- `aud`: The token audience, added as the `aud` claim in the payload. It must be a string or an array of strings. This will override any existing value in the claim.
- `iss`: The token audience, added as the `iss` claim in the payload. It must be a string. This will override any existing value in the claim.
- `sub`: The token audience, added as the `sub` claim in the payload. It must be a string. This will override any existing value in the claim.
- `nonce`: The token audience, added as the `nonce` claim in the payload. It must be a string. This will override any existing value in the claim.
- `kid`: The token key id, added as the `kid` claim in the header section. It must be a string.
- `header`: Additional claims to add to the header section. This will override the `typ` and `kid` claims.
- `noTimestamp`: If the `iat` claimÂ should not be added to the token.
- `clockTimestamp`: The timestamp in milliseconds (like the output of `Date.now()`) that should be used as the current time for all necessary time comparisons. Default is the system time.

The signer is a function which accepts a payload and returns the token.

The payload must be a object, a buffer or a string. If not a object, all the options of the signer which modify the the payload will be ignored. If `iat` claim is already present, it won't be overwritten with the current timestamp.

If the `secret` option is a function or `useWorkers` is `true`, the signer will also accept a Node style callback and will return a promise, supporting therefore both callback and async/await styles.

#### Example

```javascript
const {createSigner} = require('fast-jwt')

// Sync style
const signSync = createSigner({ secret: 'secret' })
const token = signSync({a: 1, b: 2, c: 3})
// => eyJhbGciOiJIUzUxMiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJhIjoxLCJiIjoyLCJjIjozLCJpYXQiOjE1Nzk1MjEyMTJ9.mIcxteEVjbh2MnKQ3EQlojZojGSyA_guqRBYHQURcfnCSSBTT2OShF8lo9_ogjAv-5oECgmCur_cDWB7x3X53g

// Callback style
const signWithCallback = createSigner({ secret: (callback) => callback(null, 'secret') })

signWithCallback({a: 1, b: 2, c: 3}, (err, token) => {
  // token === eyJhbGciOiJIUzUxMiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJhIjoxLCJiIjoyLCJjIjozLCJpYXQiOjE1Nzk1MjEyMTJ9.mIcxteEVjbh2MnKQ3EQlojZojGSyA_guqRBYHQURcfnCSSBTT2OShF8lo9_ogjAv-5oECgmCur_cDWB7x3X53g
})

// Promise style - Note that the secret function style and the signer function style are unrelated
async function test() {
  const signWithPromise = createSigner({ async secret(): => 'secret' })

  const token = await signWithPromise({a: 1, b: 2, c: 3})
  // => eyJhbGciOiJIUzUxMiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJhIjoxLCJiIjoyLCJjIjozLCJpYXQiOjE1Nzk1MjEyMTJ9.mIcxteEVjbh2MnKQ3EQlojZojGSyA_guqRBYHQURcfnCSSBTT2OShF8lo9_ogjAv-5oECgmCur_cDWB7x3X53g
}
```

### createDecoder

Create a decoder function by calling `createDecoder` and providing one or more of the following options:

- `complete`: Return an object with the decoded header, payload, signature and input (the token part before the signature), instead of just the content of the payload. Default is `false`.
- `json`: Always parse the payload as JSON even if the `typ` claim of the header is not `JWT`. Default is `false`.
- `encoding`: The token encoding, default is `utf-8`.

The decoder is a function which accepts a token (as Buffer or string) and returns the payload or the sections of the token.

#### Examples

```javascript
const { createDecoder } = require('fast-jwt')
const token =
  'eyJhbGciOiJIUzUxMiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJhIjoxLCJiIjoyLCJjIjozLCJpYXQiOjE1Nzk1MjEyMTJ9.mIcxteEVjbh2MnKQ3EQlojZojGSyA_guqRBYHQURcfnCSSBTT2OShF8lo9_ogjAv-5oECgmCur_cDWB7x3X53g'

// Standard decoder
const decode = createDecoder()
const payload = decode(token)
// => { a: 1, b: 2, c: 3, iat: 1579521212 }

// Complete decoder
const decodeComplete = createDecoder({ complete: true })
const sections = decodeComplete(token)
/* => 
  { 
    header: { alg: 'HS512', typ: 'JWT' }, 
    payload: { a: 1, b: 2, c: 3, iat: 1579521212 },
    signature: 'mIcxteEVjbh2MnKQ3EQlojZojGSyA/guqRBYHQURcfnCSSBTT2OShF8lo9/ogjAv+5oECgmCur/cDWB7x3X53g==',
    input: 'eyJhbGciOiJIUzUxMiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJhIjoxLCJiIjoyLCJjIjozLCJpYXQiOjE1Nzk1MjEyMTJ9' 
  }
*/
```

### createVerifier

Create a verifier function by calling `createVerifier` and providing one or more of the following options:

- `secret`: A string, buffer or object containing the secret for `HS*` algorithms or the PEM encoded public key for `RS*`, `PS*` and `ES*` algorithms (whose format is defined by the Node's crypto module documentation). The secret can also be a function accepting a Node style callback or a function returning a promise. This is the only mandatory option, which must NOT be provided if the token algorithm is `none`.
- `algorithms`: List of strings with the names of the allowed algorithms. By default, all algorithms are accepted.
- `complete`: Return an object with the decoded header, payload, signature and input (the token part before the signature), instead of just the content of the payload. Default is `false`.
- `encoding`: The token encoding. Default is `utf-8`.
- `useWorkers`: Use worker_threads for cryptographic operations. On Node version below 11.7.0, this needs the process to be started with node flag `--experimental-workers` flag.
- `allowedJti`: A string, a regular expression, an array of strings or an array of regular expressions containing allowed values for the id claim (`jti`). By default, all values are accepted.
- `allowedAud`: A string, a regular expression, an array of strings or an array of regular expressions containing allowed values for the audience claim (`aud`). By default, all values are accepted.
- `allowedIss`: A string, a regular expression, an array of strings or an array of regular expressions containing allowed values for the issuer claim (`iss`). By default, all values are accepted.
- `allowedSub`: A string, a regular expression, an array of strings or an array of regular expressions containing allowed values for the subject claim (`sub`). By default, all values are accepted.
- `allowedNonce`: A string, a regular expression, an array of strings or an array of regular expressions containing allowed values for the nonce claim (`nonce`). By default, all values are accepted.
- `ignoreExpiration`: Do not validate the expiration of the token. Default is `false`.
- `ignoreNotBefore`: Do not validate the activation of the token. Default is `false`.
- `maxAge`: The maximum allowed age (in milliseconds) for tokens to still be valid. By default this is not checked.
- `clockTimestamp`: The timestamp in milliseconds (like the output of `Date.now()`) that should be used as the current time for all necessary time comparisons. Default is the system time.
- `clockTolerance`: Timespan in milliseconds to add the current timestamp when performing time comparisons. Default is `0`.

The verifier is a function which accepts a token (as Buffer or string) and returns the payload or the sections of the token.

If the `secret` option is a function or `useWorkers` is `true`, the verifier will also accept a Node style callback and will return a promise, supporting therefore both callback and async/await styles.

#### Examples

```javascript
const { createVerifier } = require('fast-jwt')
const token =
  'eyJhbGciOiJIUzUxMiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJhIjoxLCJiIjoyLCJjIjozLCJpYXQiOjE1Nzk1MjEyMTJ9.mIcxteEVjbh2MnKQ3EQlojZojGSyA_guqRBYHQURcfnCSSBTT2OShF8lo9_ogjAv-5oECgmCur_cDWB7x3X53g'

// Sync style
const verifySync = createVerifier({ secret: 'secret' })
const payload = verifySync(token)
// => { a: 1, b: 2, c: 3, iat: 1579521212 }

// Callback style with complete return
const verifyWithCallback = createVerifier({ secret: callback => callback(null, 'secret'), complete: true })

verifyWithCallback(token, (err, sections) => {
  /*
  sections === {
    header: { alg: 'HS512', typ: 'JWT' },
    payload: { a: 1, b: 2, c: 3, iat: 1579521212 },
    signature: 'mIcxteEVjbh2MnKQ3EQlojZojGSyA/guqRBYHQURcfnCSSBTT2OShF8lo9/ogjAv+5oECgmCur/cDWB7x3X53g==',
    input: 'eyJhbGciOiJIUzUxMiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJhIjoxLCJiIjoyLCJjIjozLCJpYXQiOjE1Nzk1MjEyMTJ9'
  }
*/
})

// Promise style - Note that the secret function style and the verifier function style are unrelated
async function test() {
  const verifyWithPromise = createVerifier({ async secret(): => 'secret' })

  const payload = await verifyWithPromise(token)
  // => { a: 1, b: 2, c: 3, iat: 1579521212 }
}
```
